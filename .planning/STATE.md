# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Every function in Garvan's Maple packages works correctly in Q-Symbolic, producing matching output -- so researchers can switch without losing any capability.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Expression Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Expression Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 62 v1 requirements; strict linear dependency chain
- [Roadmap]: Python API placed after qseries parity (Phase 5) so Rust API stabilizes first
- [Roadmap]: Partition basics (PART-01 through PART-03) grouped with core q-series (Phase 3) since they are natural applications of q-Pochhammer
- [Roadmap]: Mock theta and Bailey chains grouped together (Phase 8) as the most advanced extensions

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Andrews' algorithm (prodmake/etamake/jacprodmake) needs implementation strategy research in Phase 4
- [Research]: Identity proving (Phase 7) needs deep research on cusp theory and valence formula
- [Research]: Mock theta and Bailey chains (Phase 8) need algorithm extraction from academic literature
