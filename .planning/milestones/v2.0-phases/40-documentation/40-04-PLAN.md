<objective>
Complete rewrite of chapter 14 (Maple Migration Guide) from an alphabetical alias table to a workflow-oriented guide with two-column Maple/Kangaroo comparison tables, focusing on remaining differences and celebrating where syntax is now identical.

Purpose: Per user decisions, the migration guide should be task-oriented ("Computing eta products", "Finding congruences", "Theta identities"), use two-column tables for scannable comparison, focus only on remaining differences, and live as a chapter in the PDF manual. A Maple researcher looks up "how do I do X?" and sees immediately what to type.

Output: Completely rewritten 14-maple-migration.typ with workflow sections, comparison tables, and remaining-differences focus.

  <name>Task 1: Rewrite chapter 14 as workflow-oriented migration guide</name>
  <files>manual/chapters/14-maple-migration.typ</files>
  <action>
Complete rewrite of chapter 14. Delete ALL existing content after the import line and rewrite from scratch.

Structure the chapter as follows:

**Chapter title:** `= Maple Migration Guide` (rename from "Maple Migration Quick Reference")

**Intro paragraph:** q-Kangaroo v2.0 accepts Garvan's exact Maple calling conventions for all qseries/thetaids functions. Researchers can copy commands directly from Maple worksheets. This guide is organized by workflow -- look up what you want to do, and the table shows side-by-side syntax. Where Maple and q-Kangaroo syntax is identical (most functions), the table confirms it. Where differences remain, they are highlighted.

**Section: == Overview**
Brief statement: most qseries functions now use identical syntax between Maple and q-Kangaroo. Key wins: aqprod, etaq, sift, prodmake, findlincombo, findcong -- all accept Garvan's exact argument lists. The main remaining differences are: (1) parameter encoding for monomials in product functions, (2) hypergeometric series use integer-triple encoding, (3) some function names differ (aliases available).

**Section: == Computing Eta Products**
Two-column table showing eta-product workflows:
```
Maple: etaq(q, 1, 20)          | Kangaroo: etaq(q, 1, 20)
Maple: etaq(q, [1,2,3], 20)    | Kangaroo: etaq(q, [1,2,3], 20)
Maple: prodmake(f, q, 10)      | Kangaroo: prodmake(f, q, 10)
Maple: etamake(f, q, 10)       | Kangaroo: etamake(f, q, 10)
```
Note: "Syntax is identical. No translation needed."

**Section: == Analyzing Series**
Two-column table:
```
Maple: sift(f, q, 5, 4, 50)    | Kangaroo: sift(f, q, 5, 4, 50)
Maple: prodmake(f, q, 20)      | Kangaroo: prodmake(f, q, 20)
Maple: mprodmake(f, q, 20)     | Kangaroo: mprodmake(f, q, 20)
Maple: qfactor(f, q)           | Kangaroo: qfactor(f, q)
Maple: checkmult(f, 30)        | Kangaroo: checkmult(f, 30)
Maple: checkprod(f, 10, 30)    | Kangaroo: checkprod(f, 10, 30)
```
Note: "Syntax is identical."

**Section: == Finding Congruences**
Two-column table:
```
Maple: findcong(QS, T)             | Kangaroo: findcong(QS, T)
Maple: findcong(QS, T, LM)        | Kangaroo: findcong(QS, T, LM)
Maple: findcong(QS, T, LM, XSET)  | Kangaroo: findcong(QS, T, LM, XSET)
```
Worked example: discovering Ramanujan's congruences. Show:
```
p := partition_gf(200):
findcong(p, 200)
```
Note: "Output format matches Garvan: [B, A, R] triples."

**Section: == Discovering Relations**
Two-column table:
```
Maple: findlincombo(f, L, SL, q, 0)        | Kangaroo: findlincombo(f, L, SL, q, 0)
Maple: findhomcombo(f, L, q, 2, 0)         | Kangaroo: findhomcombo(f, L, q, 2, 0)
Maple: findprod(FL, 2, 10, 30)             | Kangaroo: findprod(FL, 2, 10, 30)
Maple: findpoly(x, y, q, 2, 2)            | Kangaroo: findpoly(x, y, q, 2, 2)
```
Note: "All relation functions accept Garvan's exact signatures including symbolic labels."

**Section: == Theta Functions and Jacobi Products**
Two-column table:
```
Maple: theta(z, q, T)               | Kangaroo: theta(z, q, T)
Maple: JAC(1,5) * JAC(4,5)          | Kangaroo: JAC(1,5) * JAC(4,5)
Maple: jac2prod(JP, q, T)           | Kangaroo: jac2prod(JP, q, T)
Maple: jac2series(JP, q, T)         | Kangaroo: jac2series(JP, q, T)
Maple: qs2jaccombo(f, q, T)         | Kangaroo: qs2jaccombo(f, q, T)
```
Note: "All Jacobi product operations use identical syntax."

**Section: == Product Functions**
Two-column table showing where syntax IS identical:
```
Maple: aqprod(q^2, q, 5)            | Kangaroo: aqprod(q^2, q, 5)
Maple: aqprod(q, q, infinity, 20)   | Kangaroo: aqprod(q, q, infinity, 20)
Maple: jacprod(1, 5, q, 30)         | Kangaroo: jacprod(1, 5, q, 30)
Maple: tripleprod(q^3, q, 20)       | Kangaroo: tripleprod(q^3, q, 20)
Maple: quinprod(q^2, q, 20)         | Kangaroo: quinprod(q^2, q, 20)
Maple: winquist(q, q^2, q, 10)      | Kangaroo: winquist(q, q^2, q, 10)
Maple: qbin(q, 2, 4)                | Kangaroo: qbin(q, 2, 4)
```
Note: "Syntax is identical for all product functions."

**Section: == Remaining Differences**
Per user decision, focus only on where translation IS still needed:

1. **Partition counting:** Maple uses `numbpart(n)`, q-Kangaroo accepts both `numbpart(n)` and `partition_count(n)` (alias). No translation needed.

2. **Hypergeometric series:** Maple uses symbolic parameters; q-Kangaroo uses integer triples `(num, den, pow)` to encode q-monomials. Table:
```
Maple: qphihyper([a,b],[c],q,z,N)  | Kangaroo: phi([(1,1,a_pow),...], [...], z_n, z_d, z_p, N)
```
This is the main area where syntax differs.

3. **Function names:** Some names differ from Maple but aliases are accepted:
Two-column table of aliases:
```
Maple: proveid(...)         | Kangaroo: prove_eta_id(...) [alias: proveid]
Maple: qZeil(...)          | Kangaroo: q_zeilberger(...) [alias: qzeil]
Maple: qgosper(...)        | Kangaroo: q_gosper(...) [alias: qgosper]
Maple: rankgf(...)         | Kangaroo: rank_gf(...) [alias: rankgf]
Maple: crankgf(...)        | Kangaroo: crank_gf(...) [alias: crankgf]
```

4. **Session differences:** q-Kangaroo REPL uses `:=` for assignment (same as Maple), `:` suppresses output (same as Maple). No session object needed at the REPL (unlike the Python API).

**Section: == Quick Reference Card**
Compact table of the most commonly used functions (10-15 rows), showing just Maple syntax and noting "Identical in q-Kangaroo" for most, highlighting any that differ.

Add appropriate #index entries throughout: #index-main[Maple migration], #index[Maple compatibility], #index[Garvan packages], etc.
  </action>
  <verify>Read the file and verify: (1) workflow-oriented sections exist (Computing Eta Products, Analyzing Series, etc.), (2) two-column tables present, (3) no alphabetical alias table (the old format is gone), (4) remaining differences section highlights hypergeometric encoding, (5) identical syntax is noted but not enumerated row-by-row excessively.</verify>
  <done>Chapter 14 is a workflow-oriented Maple migration guide with two-column Maple/Kangaroo comparison tables, organized by task (eta products, series analysis, congruences, relations, theta/Jacobi, products). Remaining differences (hypergeometric encoding, function name aliases) are clearly highlighted. The guide celebrates that most qseries syntax is now identical.</done>
