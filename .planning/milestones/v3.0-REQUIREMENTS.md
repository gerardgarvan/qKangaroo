### Bivariate Series
- [x] **BIVAR-01**: User can call `tripleprod(z, q, T)` with symbolic z and get a Laurent polynomial in z — Phase 45
- [x] **BIVAR-02**: User can call `quinprod(z, q, T)` with symbolic z and get a bivariate Laurent polynomial — Phase 45
- [x] **BIVAR-03**: User can call `winquist(a, b, q, T)` with symbolic a, b and get a multivariate series — Phase 45
- [x] **BIVAR-04**: User can perform arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, negate) on bivariate series values — Phase 45

### Utility Functions
- [x] **UTIL-01**: User can call `floor(x)` to compute the floor of a rational number — Phase 43
- [x] **UTIL-02**: User can call `legendre(m, p)` (or `L(m, p)`) to compute the Legendre symbol (m/p) — Phase 43

### Documentation
- [x] **DOC-01**: PDF manual includes a chapter on the scripting language — Phase 46
- [x] **DOC-02**: Help system (`help for`, `help proc`, `help if`) documents new scripting syntax — Phase 46
- [x] **DOC-03**: Worked examples section includes reproductions of key examples from Garvan's qmaple.pdf tutorial — Phase 46
