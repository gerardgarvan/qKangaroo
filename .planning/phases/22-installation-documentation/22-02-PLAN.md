<objective>
Rewrite docs/installation.rst to mirror the full content of INSTALL.md using proper reStructuredText formatting.

Purpose: The Sphinx documentation site must contain the same comprehensive installation guide as INSTALL.md, properly formatted with RST directives so it renders correctly and is discoverable from the docs landing page.
Output: Rewritten docs/installation.rst with pip install, build-from-source (Linux + Cygwin/Windows), and troubleshooting sections.

  <name>Task 1: Rewrite docs/installation.rst mirroring INSTALL.md content</name>
  <files>docs/installation.rst</files>
  <action>
Read the completed INSTALL.md from plan 22-01. Rewrite docs/installation.rst to contain the same information translated into proper reStructuredText.

The existing installation.rst is a 70-line placeholder. Replace it entirely with the full content from INSTALL.md, using these RST conventions:

**Structure mapping (Markdown to RST):**
- `# Heading` -> RST section with `===` underline
- `## Heading` -> RST section with `---` underline
- `### Heading` -> RST section with `^^^` underline
- Fenced code blocks -> `.. code-block:: bash` directives (with proper 3-space indentation)
- Bold text -> `**bold**` (same in RST)
- Inline code -> `` `code` `` (same in RST)
- Bullet lists -> same syntax but ensure blank line before list
- Numbered lists -> `#.` for auto-numbering (RST convention) or `1.` explicit

**RST-specific enhancements:**
- Add `.. note::` admonition for the "GMP is bundled in wheels" note
- Add `.. warning::` admonition for the "must use x86_64-pc-windows-gnu" Rust target note
- Add `.. tip::` admonition for the verification command
- Use `.. code-block:: bash` for shell commands and `.. code-block:: python` for Python snippets
- Use `.. code-block:: text` for error message examples in troubleshooting

**Troubleshooting section:** Use definition list style or bold problem headers with nested content. Each problem should have clear Symptom / Cause / Fix formatting.

**Keep the title as:** `Installation` with `============` underline (matching the existing page title so the toctree reference in index.rst continues to work).

Do NOT add any cross-reference to INSTALL.md itself (the RST version should be fully self-contained). Do NOT add `.. include::` directives -- duplicate the content so it stands alone.

Ensure blank lines before and after all directives (RST requirement). Ensure consistent indentation (3 spaces for directive content).
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify the file has been rewritten with full content:
- `grep -c "pip install q-kangaroo" docs/installation.rst` returns at least 1
- `grep -c "Cygwin" docs/installation.rst` returns at least 1
- `grep -c "apt-get" docs/installation.rst` returns at least 1
- `grep -c "Troubleshooting" docs/installation.rst` returns at least 1
- `grep -c "x86_64-pc-windows-gnu" docs/installation.rst` returns at least 1
- `grep -c "code-block" docs/installation.rst` returns at least 5 (multiple code blocks)
- `grep -c "partition_count" docs/installation.rst` returns at least 1
- File is significantly longer than the original 70 lines (should be 200+ lines)
- `wc -l docs/installation.rst` shows 200+ lines
  </verify>
  <done>
docs/installation.rst is a complete RST rewrite mirroring all INSTALL.md content: pip install, Linux build-from-source, Cygwin/Windows build-from-source, and troubleshooting. Uses proper RST directives (code-block, note, warning, tip). Renders correctly with Sphinx and is linked from the existing index.rst toctree.
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
- docs/installation.rst exists with 200+ lines of content
- Contains all sections from INSTALL.md: pip install, Linux, Cygwin/Windows, troubleshooting
- Uses proper RST directives: code-block, note, warning, tip
- Page title remains "Installation" (preserving index.rst toctree link)
- All code blocks use appropriate language tags (bash, python, text)
- No broken RST syntax (blank lines around directives, proper indentation)

<success_criteria>
- INST-05 is satisfied: installation.rst mirrors INSTALL.md with full Sphinx formatting
- The page is accessible from the Sphinx landing page via the existing toctree
- A user reading the Sphinx docs gets identical information to reading INSTALL.md
