<objective>
Update README.md and docs/index.rst to cross-reference the installation guide created in Phase 22, so users can discover it from every entry point.

Purpose: Users arriving at the GitHub repo (README) or the Sphinx docs site (index.rst) should immediately find a path to detailed installation instructions.
Output: Updated README.md with INSTALL.md link; updated index.rst with prominent installation reference in the Getting Started section.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add INSTALL.md cross-reference to README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Modify the Installation section of README.md to add a clear pointer to INSTALL.md. The current section has a pip install command and a Note blockquote with a brief source build snippet.

Replace the existing `> **Note:** q-Kangaroo is in pre-release. To install from source:` blockquote (lines 19-26) with a single line pointing to the full guide:

```
For build-from-source instructions, platform-specific guides, and troubleshooting, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
```

Keep everything else in the Installation section unchanged (the pip install command, the Requirements line). The blockquote's abbreviated source-install snippet is redundant now that INSTALL.md has comprehensive instructions.

Also add a reference to check_install.py in the existing Verification section. After the existing one-liner verification command, add:

```
For a comprehensive check (including build prerequisites), run:

```bash
python check_install.py          # End-user checks
python check_install.py --dev    # + build-from-source checks
```
```

Do NOT change any other section of README.md.
  </action>
  <verify>Read README.md and confirm: (1) INSTALL.md is linked in the Installation section, (2) the old blockquote source-install snippet is removed, (3) check_install.py is mentioned in the Verification section, (4) all other sections are unchanged.</verify>
  <done>README.md Installation section links to INSTALL.md. Verification section references check_install.py. No other changes.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add installation guide link to docs/index.rst Getting Started</name>
  <files>docs/index.rst</files>
  <action>
Modify docs/index.rst to add a prominent installation reference in the Getting Started section. The toctree already has `installation` in the User Guide section, but the Getting Started callout boxes don't mention it.

Add a new admonition BEFORE the existing "New to q-series?" tip, making it the first thing users see:

```rst
.. important:: **First time installing?**

   Follow the step-by-step installation guide for pip install, building from
   source, and troubleshooting common issues.

   :doc:`installation`
```

This uses `.. important::` to visually distinguish it from the existing `.. tip::`, `.. note::`, and `.. seealso::` boxes. The `installation` reference resolves to the installation.rst page created in Phase 22 (already in the toctree).

Do NOT change the toctree entries, the What's Inside section, or any other part of index.rst.
  </action>
  <verify>Read docs/index.rst and confirm: (1) new "First time installing?" admonition exists in Getting Started section, (2) it references :doc:`installation`, (3) existing content is unchanged, (4) toctree still has installation entry.</verify>
  <done>docs/index.rst has a prominent installation link in the Getting Started section. Existing toctree and content unchanged.</done>
</task>

<verification>
- README.md contains `[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)` link in Installation section
- README.md Verification section mentions check_install.py
- docs/index.rst Getting Started section contains `:doc:`installation`` reference in an important admonition
- No unintended changes to other sections of either file
</verification>

<success_criteria>
README.md links to INSTALL.md for detailed instructions. docs/index.rst has a prominent installation guide link in the Getting Started section. Users arriving at either entry point immediately find the path to comprehensive installation documentation.
