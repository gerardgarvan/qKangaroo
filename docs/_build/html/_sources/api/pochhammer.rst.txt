$q$-Pochhammer and $q$-Binomial
================================

The $q$-Pochhammer symbol $(a;q)_n$ is the fundamental building block of
$q$-series. The $q$-binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}_q$ (also called the
Gaussian binomial) is built from $q$-Pochhammer symbols. Both are computed
as formal power series with exact rational coefficients.
